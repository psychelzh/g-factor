}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame with subject identifiers and outcome variables.}

\item{subjs_info}{A data frame with subject identifiers and covariates. The
FD values should be named as \code{mean_fd_task} and \code{mean_fd_rest} for n-back
task and resting state data, respectively. And the first column should be
the subject identifier.}

\item{covars}{A character vector specifying the column names of covariates to
be included. If set as \code{TRUE} (default), all covariates will be regressed
out (not including FD values, those are treated in \code{cond}). If set as
\code{NULL}, no covariates will be regressed out.}

\item{cond}{A character string specifying which FD values to be regressed
out. It can be either \code{nbackrun1}, \code{rest}, or \code{run1rest}. If set as \code{NULL}
