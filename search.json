It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings catching on, making sense of things, or figuring out what to do.” (Gottfredson, 1997)\n“A general cognitive ability related to solving problems efficiently and effectively.” (Barbey, 2021)"
