It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather, it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings catching on, making sense of things, or figuring out what to do.\" [@gottfredson1997]\n-   \"A general cognitive ability related to solving problems efficiently and effectively.\" [@thecamb2021]\n\n## Intelligence and g\n\n::: incremental\n-   General intelligence (i.e., g-factor) was first proposed by Spearman [-@spearman1904] to account for the \"positive manifold\" phenomenon of cognitive tests.\n\n-   Given the term \"intelligence\" is hard to define and easily leads to confusion, many researchers (see Jensen [-@jensen1998]) focused on the g (i.e., general intelligence) [@haier2017; @thecamb2021].\n\n-   Current cognitive scientists also defined intelligence as general cognitive ability [@thecamb2021], which can be derived by multiple cognitive tasks\n:::\n\n## Diagram of g and its Relatives\n\n![Conceptual relationships among mental abilities, intelligence, IQ, and the g-factor [@theinte2013]](images/mental-ability-diagram.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n::: notes\nSavants are those with very high specific abilities but no general intelligence (e.g., Kim Peek, AI of current days).\n:::\n\n## Measure of g\n\n::: incremental\n-   Two major influences: **sampling of participants** and **sampling of cognitive tasks**\n\n-   Here we focus on the issue of tasks sampling\n\n    -   Factor analysis method\n\n    -   Task sampling representativeness\n:::\n\n## Factor Modeling\n\n::: incremental\n-   There are several different factor analysis modeling method:\n\n    -   Spearman Model\n\n    -   Bifactor Model\n\n    -   Orthogonalized Hierarchical Model\n\n-   Jensen [-@jensen1998] found that the g-factor scores is extremely stable among different methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.991 to 1.000.
